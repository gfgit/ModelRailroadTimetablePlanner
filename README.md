for driving and dispatching trains on big layouts like in FREMO Meetings.

# Main features
- Railway timetable graph per each line in SVG, PDF or printed
- Group jobs (trains) in work shift
- Export booklets in ODT (Libreoffice Writer) for shifts and stations
- Importation of rollingstock pieces from other sessions or ODS Spreadsheet

# Project history
The development started as a small hobby project back in 2016,
in collaboration with italian FREMO organizations.
It was rewritten from scratch due to core instsbilities and limitations.
Since then it has grown to the point I cannot manage it alone anymore.
So I published it on Github hoping to keep it alive.


# Project motto

Less time spent on the computer,
more time to have fun on your railway Layout!!!
