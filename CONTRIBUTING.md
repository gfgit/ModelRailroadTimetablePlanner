# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

I'm New to Git and Github so I don't know yet how to manage repositories and contributions.

The model should be creating pull requests with topic branches and merging on master or `master` or `develop`.


# Usage of branches

- `master`: stable code ready to be released

- `develop`: unstable code or code that needs further testing

To develop new features please create new branches and finally merge to develop

# Suggestions
If you think this workflow model is not efficient please let me know!
